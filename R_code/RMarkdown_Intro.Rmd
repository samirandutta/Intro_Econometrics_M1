# Introduction

## Preliminaries

This is an R Markdown document. For our purposes, it will allow you to produce documents in a *LaTeX* format while writing/executing your **R** code simultaneously. This is particularly efficient as it allows you to make simultaneous changes to both environments in a single interface i.e., *R Studio*.

The text can be written in the source editor (the same space that you use to write code in a usual .R script), while the R code is written/executed in a *chunk*. This will allow you to write and code in a specific chronological order.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. This particular RMarkdown file is set to create a *.pdf* file by specifying -- `output: pdf_document` in the preamble (there are various output types: *.docx*, *.pptx* etc.). If you wish to run your R code without "knitting" a pdf document, click on the dark green run button on the respective chunk.

## Equations and Code Chunks

Suppose that we are interested in the following regression model:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 education_i + u_i
\end{equation}
```
We can write the corresponding code to run the linear regression in a R code chunk. To display the code in your document while hiding the results, set `echo = TRUE` and `results = "hide"`. This results in:

\vspace{0.6cm}

```{r echo=TRUE, results = "hide"}
reg <- lm(wage ~ educ, data = wage_data)
summary(reg)
```

If you want to display the results from the regression, set: `results = "show"`. This will give you the regression output:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "show"}
reg <- lm(wage ~ educ, data = wage_data)
summary(reg)
```

## Plots

If you wish to create a plot but not display it, use `fig.show = "hide"`. *Note:* using `results = "hide"` only hides textual results as in the summary output of the regression.

\vspace{0.6cm}

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide"}
plot(wage_data$educ, wage_data$wage,
     main = "",
     xlab = "Years of Education",
     ylab = "Hourly Wage",
     pch = 19,         # Solid circles for points
     col = "blue")     # Set color for points
```

\vspace{0.6cm}

Display the scatter plot by setting `fig.show = "show"` and hide the R code by setting `echo = FALSE`, as follows:

\vspace{0.6cm}

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.show = "show", fig.cap="Write your caption here"}
plot(wage_data$educ, wage_data$wage,
     main = "",
     xlab = "Years of Education",
     ylab = "Hourly Wage",
     pch = 19,         # Solid circles for points
     col = "blue")     # Set color for points
```
