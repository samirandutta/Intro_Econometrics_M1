# Intro_Econometrics_M1

This repository contains the course materials for the Economics and Psychology program, jointly offered by Université Paris 1, Université Paris Cité, and the Paris School of Economics.

The course offers a comprehensive introduction to master-level econometrics, with a focus on both theoretical concepts and practical applications. It also incorporates essential training in R programming, with the aim of equipping students with the skills needed for data analysis and empirical research. While no prior programming experience is required, the R exercises are closely aligned with the concepts discussed in the course.
